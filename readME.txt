There seems to be a disconnect between running the site locally and running it from GitHub.  Running on local, everything displays correctly...
and the top banner is present.  For whatever reason, settings get lost in translation. I've used percentages as much as possible, but it still 
doesn't act the way I intended.

This webapp was an attempt at a crunchyroll.com redesign using react to make it easier to navigate by using single page navigation.  The idea was
to keep the crunchyroll feel while augmenting it with a new and fresh UX that seems a bit more intuitive.  The content panel would essentially
incorporate interactive links, with all links navigating to the same content panel. ...single page navigation!  There no more need to use the back
button and hope your progress on the page is still there.
